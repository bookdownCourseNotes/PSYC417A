# Preamble

## Caution
**This book was made for studying purposes only.** I will be adding notes from other sources and I may leave out some topics from the course. Also, I will not be purchasing or reading the supplemental text. As such, this is not a faithful representation of the course. 

## Acknowledgments
This course was taught by [Dr. Jason Rights](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/jason-rights/)! 

## Course goals
There are three primary goals of this course. The first goal is to provide students with sound foundational knowledge in the theory and concepts of linear regression analysis. The second goal is to develop an ability to properly apply regression methods to empirical data, including making informed decisions about analytic strategies and understanding how to report results. The third goal is to be able to critically evaluate the use of linear regression methods in research literature and the news. This course requires the successful completion of PSYC 218.

## Readings
* Supplemental textbook (not required): Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S. G., & Aiken, L. S. (2003). *Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences.* (3rd edition). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.

## Course content
**Note:** Bolded weeks indicates that a problem set is due or there is a midterm.
